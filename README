Alliance Subscriptions PlugIn

This allows you to subscribe to a friend's Alliance share folder and get their changes automatically.

STATUS

The functionality is written, and it detects changes just fine, but it gets to the part where it should schedule
a download and then... nothing.  Well, sometimes it actually works: if I set the last_any_modified field
in the subscription setting then it'll usually download one or more of the files, so I know that the
download code CAN work (eg. the ViewShareMDIWindow.download() approach).  But most often it gets to the 
System.out where it's trying a download approach and then just fails to do the download.  Annoying!
Anyway, hopefully I'll get an answer on this issue: http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/issues/detail?id=36

USAGE

This is built to work with the latest trunk (r 235 at http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta).
It may work work with the latest official release 1.0.6, but I haven't tried it.

To add this plugin, go to View, then Plugins, and point to the jar file.

To add a subscription, go to the Debug Console and enter a 'newfsub' command.  Here's the basic syntax:

newfsub FRIEND-GUID FRIEND-SHARE FRIEND-SHARE-SUB-DIR MY-LOCAL-DIR 0

Here's an example:

newfsub 1643718002 alliance-on-trunk subscribe-to-this/ /Users/tlarson/dev/alliance/working-trunk2/working/sub-to-trunk 0

You'll probably have to look in your settings.xml file to find your friend's GUID.
